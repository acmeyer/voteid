Election Voting Platform
=================

Intro
=================

We currently live in a world where we can do almost anything we want with a mobile phone but we still vote for our elected officials using a paper and pencil. There are many reasons for why this is the case but it's about time we eliminate these reasons and create a modern digital voting platform. There is no better way to do this then to tap into the Github community.

Task
================

The current US voting system in place is ancient and not secure. Voter fraud is rampant, officials want to restrict certain people from voting, and we live in the 21st century yet we vote like its the 18th century; it's about time we make a change. The purpose of this project is to initiate this change. If the US government isn't going to start a Github project dedicated to it then we will and submit it to them when its ready.

Namecoin Protocol
================

Most of you are aware of the power of the Bitcoin protocol as a means to verify digital transactions. The plan is to piggyback on the Namecoin protocol but to customize it for election voting. This will be challenging but having the protocol already implemented in many ways helps us to pick and choose what methods work best for this particular situation.

I hope you will join me in helping create a digital voting platform we can finally trust and use in our elections.

Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this project!
